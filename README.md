# FactorialCalculation
Hello This is a C program to calculate Factorial of a number using the recursion method.

Factorial of a number is as follows:- 

5! = 5 * 4 * 3* 2 * 1 ( ! is the symbol for factorial.)

Similarly, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

So, 5! = 5 * (4* 3 * 2 * 1) = 5 * 4!

This implies to the formula:- 

n! = n*(n-1)! (This very formula is used in recursion.)
